# Homestay Testing Project

## About the Project
This project involves **end-to-end manual and automated testing** of a web-based application for a homestay platform. The application allows:
- **Guests** to book homestays and manage their bookings.
- **Caretakers** to handle bookings and interact with guests.
- **House Owners** to view booking details and guest information.

As a QA tester, my focus was to ensure the platform's **functionality**, **usability**, and **reliability** through meticulous planning and execution of testing activities.
